# Work-Day-Scheduler
A calendar to save events every hour between (9amâ€“5pm)
The motivation for this project is to run & feature HTML & CSS powered by jQuery. 
This daily planner project is to create a working-day, time-block event schedule. 
A problem solved is to use a Day.js library to work with a day & time.
I learned refactoring code to meet acceptable criteria using jQuery & Day.js.
